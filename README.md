# Beacon
An iOS app that facilitates short range communication during natural disasters using infrastructure Wi-Fi, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Ethernet. In addition, Beacon also (statically) provides information regarding emergency procedures for different disasters.

## "App Store" Pitch 
Hazard? In the midst of an emergency? No internet? Beacon will connect you with those around you so you can get help if you need it or give help if you are able.

Beacon keeps critical information about what to do before, during, and in the aftermath of a major hazard on your phone so you can focus on the task at hand and not worry about losing your internet connection.

## Highlights 
* Peer-to-peer technology to message people within proximity.
* Locally tailored for BC residents and sourced from the province of British Columbia's Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Recovery program "guided by four pillars: Mitigation, Preparation, Response, and Recovery"

## Technologies and Frameworks
We used SwiftUI, MessageKit, and MultipeerConnectivity.

## What's next / Upcoming features
If given more time, we would liked to have implemented the ability to send your family, friends, coworkers your location and status (can help/need help/safe), as well as tailored messages (in the form of emails or texts).
